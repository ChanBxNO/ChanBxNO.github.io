   <h1>Kanye West x Louis Vuitton</h1>
   <h2>Release Date: July 1,2009</h2>
   <h3>This collection was the first time the world would see a Kanye West-designed sneaker, and they made their debut at Paris Fashion Week in early 2009.Named after West’s longtime friends, including fellow creative Don “Don C” Crawley, his barber Ibn Jasper, and his then-G.O.O.D. Music signee Mr. Hudson, these sneakers were inspired by ‘80s sci-fi movies and seemed to—intentionally or not—mirror West’s spoiler like hairstyle of the time. The color schemes ranged from minimal (white) to eclectic (tan, brown, pink), while the standouts—a red pair of the “Dons”—would foreshadow the Red Octobers to come. </h3>

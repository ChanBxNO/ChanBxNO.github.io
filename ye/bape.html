    <h1> Kanye West Bapesta </h1>
    <h2>Release Date: January 2, 2007</h2>
    <h3>This collab was limited to one ultra-rare release, and was based on the color scheme of Kanye West’s debut album, The College Dropout. This sneaker was released at the peak of the Bapesta’s and BAPE’s streetwear relevance. This shoe has become a literal gem because this is the only Kanye and Bape collab ever released. Once celebs or collectors get their hands on an original pair they keep them because of the history and especially the cost. </h3>

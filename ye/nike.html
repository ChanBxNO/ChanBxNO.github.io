   <h1>Nike Air Yeezy 1</h1>
   <p>Nike had never created a signature sneaker for a non-athlete. As such, the release of the Yeezy 1 would change the industry forever. The Air Yeezy 1, which was co-designed by Nike’s Mark Smith, was defined by its ultra-high top design, Jordan III-esque sole unit, and strap across the toe box—a feature West would return to numerous times both at Nike and later adidas.Thinking back to the release of the Air Yeezy 1 triggers some heavy nostalgia, given the lack of apps, bots, and other nonsense that surrounded it. You wanted a pair? You waited in line, perhaps for days, outside your local Nike retailer and prayed to the sneaker gods for mercy.</p>
   <h2>Release Date: April 4, 2009</h2>
   <h3>Nike Air Yeezy 2</h3>
   <h4>Release Date: June 9, 2012</h4>
   <h5>Three years after the Nike Air Yeezy 1, the Air Yeezy 2 would hit shelves in a 5,000 pair, limited edition fashion,and with one less colorway than the Yeezy 1—at least for the 2012 drop. Designed alongside Nike’s Nathan Van Hook, the sole unit was swapped over to that from a Nike Air Tech Challenge II, and featured a reptile-esque texture on the upper that was in line with West’s Givenchy-heavy wardrobe of the time. The sneakers also featured an Egyptian hieroglyphic-like bird inside of a circle inside of a triangle embossed on the tongue. Like the Air Yeezy 1, the Yeezy 2’s release was quaint by comparison to today’s tech-heavy drops, dropping online and in store, sometimes by raffle in the latter case.</h5>
